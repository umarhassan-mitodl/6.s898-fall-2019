### Project:

This mostly reflects the oral and written components due at the end of the semester, but points may also be lost if progress identifying, proposing, and executing a project throughout the semester is inadequate.

### Leading Discussions:

This reflects participation in the specific parts of the discussion sessions that you are assigned to lead. Responsibilities include preparing leading questions, comments, or facts based on the assigned reading, and following up with other questions and comments from students. Discussion leaders are expected to have not only completed the reading assignment, but also thought critically about its contents.

### Participation:

This reflects general participation in the course, including but not limited to contributing to class discussions, asking questions at guest lectures, posting questions or comments to Piazza, and going to TA office hours. Points will be lost if it becomes clear you have not done the readings.
